5. Update room price information

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. The "employee" view uses a navbar with white background, and the "customer" view uses a navbar with a black background. This helps to distinguish both website views from each other.
2. If the price of a room changes, existing customers with bookings will be charged the price at booking time. That means poor Sonic Hedgehog has to pay $409/night for his
   reservation of Room 106 from Sept 2 to 9, and won't be able to take advantage of my later price drop afterward to $389 unless he cancels and rebooks his reservation.
3. My prices are a tad expensive, but these are luxury rooms after all (not like those run-down hotels on Huron Church Road), and my hotel has only 6 rooms.
4. I used jQuery version 1.12.4 (not the current one) since the Bootstrap "Get Started" page used it when I started to work on the project.
   They've changed it in the past few days to 3.2.1, however. I downloaded jQuery 1.12.4 from here: http://minime.stephan-brumme.com/jquery/1.12.4/

1. Search rooms by availability from [DATE] to [DATE + N days], where 1 <= N <= 7
2. Search rooms by number of beds in the room (1 or 2 or any)
3. Order rooms by price or room number. Default "order by" is room_number, otherwise order by price (ascending or descending)
4. Occupancy rate by room
5. Occupancy rate for total hotel
6. Hotel revenue by week for whole hotel
7. Hotel revenue by week by room number
